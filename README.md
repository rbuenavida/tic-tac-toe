# tic-tac-toe

## Play
Simply open up ttt.html in your browser and start playing

## Development
If you want to update the game's javascript, run the following to transpile 
and bundle the js code:
```
./node_modules/.bin/babel ttt.js --watch --out-file ttt.bundle.js
```

## Notes
I haven't used any popular js frameworks because it's just a really simple game.
